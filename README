=======================
ech - Embedded CouchDB
=======================

Getting Started
===============

Get the source for CouchDB and note its root directory, which is used as
COUCH_HOME below.

Get the ech source from github.

At a console prompt:

 $ cd ech
 $ export COUCH_HOME=<dir>
 $ make

Running Tests
=============

 $ make TESTS=ech_tests test

Using ech
=========

Refer to ECH_HOME/lib/ech/src/ech_tests.erl for examples.

You can experiment with ech from an Erlang shell by running:

 $ make shell

Installing ech
==============

We're working on this. Until something better is available, you can simply
include ETCH_HOME in the ERL_LIBS environment variable when running your
application. E.g.

 $ ERL_LIBS=<ech home dir> erl
